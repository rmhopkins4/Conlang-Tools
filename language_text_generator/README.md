# Language Text Generator

Console app TBD

The purpose of this tool is to simulate sound changes that would occur over many many years, instantly!
Simply provide words and define sound changes and the program will transform the lexicon.

### How it Works

Edit the following variables in [app.py](https://github.com/rmhopkins4/Conlang-Tools/blob/main/language_text_generator/app.py) to use the program.

Or, you can run [console_app.py](https://github.com/rmhopkins4/Conlang-Tools/blob/main/language_text_generator/console_app.py), submitting a file following the [example_file](https://github.com/rmhopkins4/Conlang-Tools/blob/main/language_text_generator/materials/example_input.txt)'s format which is summarized briefly below.
